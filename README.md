# ALX Listing App

## Project Overview

This project is a foundational scaffold for a modern Airbnb clone.  
It is built using Next.js with TypeScript, TailwindCSS for styling, and ESLint for code quality.

The goal is to create a scalable, maintainable, and reusable codebase for building a property listing page.

## Project Structure

- **components/**  
  Contains reusable UI components such as `Card` and `Button`.

- **interfaces/**  
  TypeScript interfaces to ensure type safety and consistency.

- **constants/**  
  Stores reusable constants like API URLs and UI text.

- **public/assets/**  
  Holds images and SVG assets used in the project.

- **pages/**  
  Contains Next.js page files (e.g., `index.tsx`).

- **styles/**  
  Global CSS including Tailwind imports.
